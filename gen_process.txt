Generating from an empty scene.
User: You are an experienced room designer. Please assist me in crafting a floor plan. Each room is a rectangle. You need to define the four coordinates and specify an appropriate design scheme, including each room's color, material, and texture.
Assume the wall thickness is zero. Please ensure that all rooms are connected, not overlapped, and do not contain each other.
Note: the units for the coordinates are meters.
For example:
living room | maple hardwood, matte | light grey drywall, smooth | [(0, 0), (0, 8), (5, 8), (5, 0)]
kitchen | white hex tile, glossy | light grey drywall, smooth | [(5, 0), (5, 5), (8, 5), (8, 0)]

Here are some guidelines for you:
1. A room's size range (length or width) is 3m to 8m. The maximum area of a room is 48 m$^2$. Please provide a floor plan within this range and ensure the room is not too small or too large.
2. It is okay to have one room in the floor plan if you think it is reasonable.
3. The room name should be unique.

Now, I need a design for a living room with 4 chairs and 1 sofa and a round table.
Additional requirements: N/A.
Your response should be direct and without additional text at the beginning or end.

[32mAI: Here is the floor plan:
living room | walnut parquet flooring, matte | warm beige textured wallpaper | [(0, 0), (0, 7), (6, 7), (6, 0)]
- Place a large area rug in the center of the room with a low-pile, soft texture, in a neutral color to complement the warm beige walls.
- The sofa should be placed against the long wall (between points (0, 0) and (6, 0)) in a light grey fabric finish with plush cushions for comfort.
- The four chairs should be positioned around the round table, which will be situated at the center of the room on the area rug. Chairs should have a wooden frame to match the walnut floor and upholstered in a complementary but slightly darker shade than the sofa for contrast.
- The round table should have a walnut veneer to match the flooring, keeping a coherent design scheme, and it should be large enough to comfortably fit within the space surrounded by the chairs. Consider a diameter of around 1.2 meters for the table to facilitate easy movement around it.[39m
[32mAI: The floor plan is valid. (Only one room)[39m

User: I am now designing a living room with 4 chairs and 1 sofa and a round table. Please help me decide the wall height in meters.
Answer with a number, for example, 3.0. Do not add additional text at the beginning or in the end.

[32mAI: The wall height is 2.7[39m

User: I need assistance in designing the connections between rooms. The connections could be of three types: doorframe (no door installed), doorway (with a door), or open (no wall separating rooms). The sizes available for doorframes and doorways are single (1m wide) and double (2m wide).

Ensure that the door style complements the design of the room. The output format should be: room 1 | room 2 | connection type | size | door style. For example:
exterior | living room | doorway | double | dark brown metal door
living room | kitchen | open | N/A | N/A
living room | bedroom | doorway | single | wooden door with white frames

The design under consideration is a living room with 4 chairs and 1 sofa and a round table, which includes these rooms: living room. The length, width and height of each room in meters are:
living room: 6.0 m x 7.0 m x 2.7 m

Certain pairs of rooms share a wall: (exterior, living room). There must be a door to the exterior.
Adhere to these additional requirements: N/A.
Provide your response succinctly, without additional text at the beginning or end.

[32mAI: Here is the doorway plan:
exterior | living room | doorway | single | solid wood door with reinforced glass pane[39m
[31mThere are multiple ways between exterior and living room[39m

User: Guide me in designing the windows for each room. The window types are: fixed, hung, and slider.
The available sizes (width x height in cm) are:
fixed: (92, 120), (150, 92), (150, 120), (150, 180), (240, 120), (240, 180)
hung: (87, 160), (96, 91), (120, 160), (130, 67), (130, 87), (130, 130)
slider: (91, 92), (120, 61), (120, 91), (120, 120), (150, 92), (150, 120)

Your task is to determine the appropriate type, size, and quantity of windows for each room, bearing in mind the room's design, dimensions, and function.

Please format your suggestions as follows: room | wall direction | window type | size | quantity | window base height (cm from floor). For example:
living room | west | fixed | (130, 130) | 1 | 50

I am now designing a living room with 4 chairs and 1 sofa and a round table. The wall height is 270 cm. The walls available for window installation (direction, width in cm) in each room are:
living room: north, 600 cm; east, 700 cm; south, 600 cm; 

Please note: It is not mandatory to install windows on every available wall. Within the same room, all windows must be the same type and size.
Also, adhere to these additional requirements: Only one wall of each room should have windows.

Provide a concise response, omitting any additional text at the beginning or end. 

[32mAI: Here is the window plan:
living room | north | fixed | (240, 180) | 2 | 90

living room | east | fixed | (150, 120) | 4 | 90

living room | south | slider | (150, 120) | 4 | 70[39m

plan for living room: High-Level Design Strategy:
The larger items such as the sofa and the entertainment unit will be our anchor points since they typically sit against the walls and help define the layout of the room. We will place the sofa on a longer wall to maximize seating space, and the entertainment unit will likely sit on the opposite side to create a focal point.

Next to the sofa, armchairs can be positioned to encourage conversation and create a cozy seating area. The coffee table should be placed in the center of this sitting arrangement, serving both the sofa and armchairs. 

Bookshelves will be placed on the edges away from the main seating area to provide storage and display space without cluttering the seating space. The sideboards could back against the adjacent walls near the entrance to provide a place for decorative items, and storage.

Console tables usually go against a wall, preferably near the entrance or behind the sofa if the room layout allows, giving a place to put keys, mail, or decorative items. Floor lamps should be placed near the seating to provide adequate lighting.

Remembering to place the chairs around the coffee table and face them toward the table, here are the constraints as per your request:
